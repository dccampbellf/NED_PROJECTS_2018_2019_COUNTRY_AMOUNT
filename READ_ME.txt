WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT?

Previously in other NED-related projects I had pulled information from a single region (LATAM and Africa). 

Here: 

- I pull information from all their publicly listed projects. 
- I break-down the information by [Country] [Partner (the NGO or whatever who does the work on the group)]  [Grants Amount] [& Year - really only 2019 and 2018]

It's useful cause' this df tells you were the money is going now. In the future, if I can get past years, I may want to see evolution in funding per country (maybe even sector?). 
But in this kind of this, it's the present funding of geopolitics that matters most rather than the past -- but not the future!

Thanks.
